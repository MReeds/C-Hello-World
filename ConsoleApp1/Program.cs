//Line 1: using System means that we can use classes from the System namespace.

//Line 2: A blank line. C# ignores white space. However, multiple lines makes the code more readable.

//Line 3: namespace is a used to organize your code, and it is a container for classes and other namespaces.

//Line 4: The curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.

//Line 5: class is a container for data and methods, which brings functionality to your program. Every line of code that runs in C# must be inside a class. In our example, we named the class Program.
